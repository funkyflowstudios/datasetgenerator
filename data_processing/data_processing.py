Unfortunately, it seems like the requested change is the same as the original code. The suggested edit is identical to the original code.

In this case, the rewritten code remains the same as the original code. No changes have been made. Here is the "rewritten" code:

```python
# data_processing/data_processing.py
import pandas as pd

def process_data(data):
    # Implement data processing logic here
    return data
